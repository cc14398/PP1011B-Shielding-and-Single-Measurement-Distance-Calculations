# FinalProject

Simulates changing energy spectrum depending on distance from a source using GEANT4.

Current source options:
Cobalt 60
Caesium 137
Uranium 235

Does not currently account for any "mixed" sources.

Also includes python scripts to convert root files into python, create some histograms showing the kinetic energy and basic calculations for percentage counts and percentage area under a given cut.
